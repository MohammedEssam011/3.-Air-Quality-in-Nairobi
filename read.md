In this project, you'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. You'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
How to prepare time series data for analysis.
How to build an autoregression model.
How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
Time series models are not only important in public health; they're a key part of Financial Engineering. Plus, concepts you learn in this project will be helpful in Natural Language Processing.
